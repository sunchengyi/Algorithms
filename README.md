# Algorithms
This repository is about some small algorithms implemented by me or my own understanding 
about some alorithms.

Now it includes three files.

[1] k-means.py

    It implements a k-means class in Python with an interface similar to Scikit-Learn. 
    Two of the methods of the class are "fit()" and "predict()". And in "fit()", the 
    tatol distance is used as the metric to stop the iterations. Of course, the maximum
    number of iterations also plays its role.
    
[2] sort_merge.py

    It implements the algorithm of merge sort.
